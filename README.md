## **Overview**  
This project is focused on recreating the **printf** function from the C standard library. Through this implementation, you will gain an understanding of **variadic functions**, how formatted output works, and how to handle different data types dynamically.  

## **Project Scope**  
In this project, you will:  

- Implement a function similar to `printf` with support for various format specifiers.  
- Learn about **variadic functions** using `stdarg.h`.  
- Handle different data types, including:  
  - `%c` → Single character  
  - `%s` → String  
  - `%p` → Pointer address  
  - `%d` / `%i` → Signed decimal integer  
  - `%u` → Unsigned decimal integer  
  - `%x` / `%X` → Hexadecimal representation  
  - `%%` → Percent sign  

## **Learning Outcomes**  
- Understanding and implementing **variadic functions**.  
- Managing formatted output efficiently.  
- Deepening knowledge of **memory management** and **buffer handling**.  
- Preparing for future projects where **ft_printf** will be reused.  

## **Usage**  
### How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msabr/FT_PTINTF_1337
   cd FT_PTINTF_1337

2. Build the mandatory part:

   ```bash
   make

#### Additional commands

- `make clean`: remove object files.
- `make fclean`: remove the program and object files.
- `make re`: rebuild everything.
